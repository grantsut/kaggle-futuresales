# kaggle-futuresales
Code for the Kaggle competition "Predict Future Sales", associated with the coursera course "How to Win a Data Science Competition" https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science.

The code is mostly in the form of Jupyter notebooks which are better viewed in-situ with the output at kaggle, either the exploratory data analysis [here](https://www.kaggle.com/deinforcement/predict-future-sales-eda-data-leakage) or the data cleaning and feature engineering noteboook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/deinforcement/top-1-notebook-advanced-features-and-lightgbm).

The competition is just for practice so I haven't done the ensembling and manual adjustment steps that are necessary for a really high score, but I may come back to it later - the competition still has another 2 years left to run at the time of writing.
