# kaggle-futuresales
Code for the Kaggle competition "Predict Future Sales", associated with the coursera course "How to Win a Data Science Competition" https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science.

Code here is mostly replicated (manually) with the Kaggle notebooks found at https://www.kaggle.com/deinforcement/future-sales-leak-and-time-features/ apart from a few things which won't run on Kaggle notebooks due to memory limits.
